# Lecture 2 Exercises
I describe briefly the exercises:
  
  1. I've obtained a graph which show that for N>5 matlab built-in implementations of vectors is far better than fill a vector with a loop.

  2. I'm not able to reproduce 10 periods of the sine function without expand the ine with many many terms (that is >100).
      A nice result is obtained with 3 periods and N=25.
  3. The Heaviside function in 2D i straightforward, just an else-if chain.
